A Collection of Backronyms, Acronym Spells, and Poetic Code-Rants  
Not for glory, but for the joy of playing with words, with programming languages,  
and with the ghost of a mainframe whispering punch card poetry in ALL CAPS.
```  
  
  
```  
**A**void **D**angerous **A**ctivities *like runtime errors, dynamic memory, or _Crashing_-like languages pretending to be safe.*  
**A**ssert **D**on’t **A**ssume *and* **A**nticipate **D**isaster **A**head*.  
*Use* **A**erospace*-**D**riven **A**rchitecture *with* **A**rbitrarily **D**efensive **A**pproach.  
*This is not for your silly web-apps.*
```  
  
  
```  
**B**ecause **A**ssembly **S**imply **I**sn’t **C**ute.  
*It’s made for the* **B**eginner *to* **A**ttempt *to* **S**imulate **I**ntelligent **C**ode.  
*But is it even* **B**arely **A**ble *to* **S**ustain **I**ntelligent **C**omputation?  
*It’s* **B**ackwards **A**nd **S**tubbornly **I**mperative **C**ode, **B**arely **A**cceptable *for* **S**ystems *of* **I**nstructional **C**omputing,  
*and is probably just mean as a beginners language.*
```  
  
  
``` 
**C**rashable, *not even funny.  
Made to build operating systems… that* **c**rash.
```  
  
  
``` 
**C**ompile **C**arefully, **C**atastrophic **C**ore-dumps **C**onsidered **C**ommon_.  
*Or how many C’s does ++ refer to?  
An attempt to make simulating stuff with objects fast.  
Somehow, we all bought it, or...  
was it all just inherited?*
```  
  
  
```
**C**ee **Sharp** *for those who don’t look too sharp  
A cool language — it even has a hash in its name.  
It still needs ceremony to say hi:  
A public static class Console-ceremony, with braces in line.*
```  
  
  
```
**C**onstantly **L**oving **O**verkill, **J**ust **U**sing **R**ich’s **E**xpressions,  
and the **C**ode **L**ives **O**utside **J**ava **U**nlike **R**easonable **E**xpectations.  
Some ask – where are the types? The repl smiles back – Where’s yours?
```  
  
  
```
**C**an **O**verwhelm **B**rains **O**n **L**egacy  
*The* **C**ompiler **O**f **B**iological **O**ssified **L**ineage *that you don’t learn, but inherit from grandmom.  
It’s* **C**ode **O**f **B**uried **O**rigins, **L**atent *in your DNA, still running faster than your C# microservice.  
C# Often Breaks, Our Legacy doesn’t, you simply* **C**an’t **O**utrun **B**asic **O**ld **L**ogic.
```  
  
  
```
**D**on’t **O**verthink **T**he **N**ew **E**cosystem **T**rash  
*Not even a language but it* **D**oes **O**verhead **T**rickery **N**early **E**very **T**ime.  
*The only thing* Core *is the memory pressure.*
```  
  
  
```
**E**ventually **L**earns **I**ntuition, e**X**ecuting **I**mmaculate **R**eboots  
*So true with the Beam DNA,  
you just* **E**xpress **L**ogic **I**n e**X**treme **I**mmutable **R**efactorability.  
More stable when you don’t try to control it.
```  
  
  
```
**E**ternally **R**espawning **L**ogic, **A**lways **N**onstop **G**uarantees.  
**E**verything **R**equires **L**earning **A** **N**ew **G**rammar *but it’s* **E**asily **R**ecognized: **L**ooks **A**wkward, **N**ever **G**ives *up.  
It’s* **E**ngineered *for* **R**obustness, **L**etting **A**ll **N**odes **G**o _on._  
**E**rrors, **R**eally? **L**et’s **A**llow **N**atural **G**oodbye.
```  
  
  
```
**F**ailing **Sharp**ly when You Hit WPF. **F**or **Sharp** _minds only, because here,  
Visual Studio acts like a jazz drummer having a panic attack.  
A functional gem trapped in the sharp-looking labyrinth of imperatism. The right language in the wrong kingdom._
```  
  
  
```
**F**ast **O**perations **R**esulting *in* **T**otal **H**eadache _is stack juggling executable words in Notation Polish Reverse.  
It’s blazingly fast, so you feel like a barefoot wizard shouting spells directly at electrons, the destroyer of abstractions.  
It’s_ **F**or **O**ld **R**ebels **T**hat **H**ack **F**unctionally in **O**bscure **R**PN, **T**hat **H**urts.
```  
  
  
```
**F**ast **O**perations **R**unning **T**oward **R**etro **A**rithmetic **N**ostalgia.  
*Probably been used* **F**or **O**verengineered **R**eactors **T**hat **R**un **A**mazing **N**uclear _simulations_.
```  
  
  
```
**G**reatly **R**elaxed **O**bject-**O**riented **V**alue-**Y**ielding   
_and_ **G**reat **R**elief **O**ver **O**verbearing **V**erbosity_. **Y**et...  
people do get lost in all these DSLs.
```  
  
  
```
**G**rumpily **O**pinionated  
_No inheritance, no overloading, no excuses and_ **G**oroutines **O**nly. _A_ **G**oodbye **O**OP _with_ **G**enerics **O**mitted.  
_But then, they suddenly appear. This is a_ **G**lorified _and_ **O**bjectless _C, it’s_ **G**oogle **O**wn _language._
```  
  
  
```
**H**ardly **A**ny **S**ide-effects, _with_ **K**leisli-**E**ntangled **L**azy **L**ogic.  
_Writing code is like **H**oping **A**bstractions **S**ucceed, **K**indly **E**vading all **L**ow-Level **L**ogic.  
_But you need to grasp monoids of functors. Schrödinger makes programs pure, where side effects only exist when observed through bind.  
Programs aren’t run, promises are fulfilled._
```  
  
  
```
**J**ust **A** **V**ery **A**nnoying **Script** _where concatenation of empty lists becomes string, and where NaN actually is, in fact, a number.  
The_ **J**ammed **A**nd **V**iolently **A**ssembled **Script** _didn’t evolve. It mutated during deployment, and so does the code:  
Interpretation is a break-dance battle between type coercion and your intention._
```  
  
  
```
**J**ust **A**nother **V**ague **A**cronym _or perhaps_ **J**ust **A**nother **V**ersion _of_ **A**ssembly, _given its syntactic resemblance to low-level C.  
It’s_ **J**ust **A**nother **V**erbose **A**trocity _offering far too rigid type hierarchies and exceptions.  
It’s_ **J**ust **A**bstractions, **V**oidness, and **A**ccidental _complexity, with_ **J**udicious **A**nnotations **V**iolating _all_ **A**esthetics.
```  
  
  
```
**K**inda **O**verloads **T**he **L**anguage **I**n **N**ew-ways. 
_I assembled one today and now I’ve got a mobile app… and a backache. As easy as IKEA.  
It_ **K**indly **O**bscures **T**he **L**eaks **I**n **N**otation, _and_ **K**eeps **O**verthinking **T**ype **L**ayers **I**n **N**iceness.  
_It offers to hide the complexity, but hands it all back when you least expect it.  
Assembled with ease, followed by an existential crisis._
```  
  
  
```
**L**oads _of_ **I**ntertwined **S**ymbolic **P**arentheses _looking silly when they stack up on the same line.  
People seem to get_ **L**ost **I**n **S**illy **P**arentheses, _realizing everything appear to be lists, including doubts.  
Until you realize that the_ **L**ogic **I**s **S**tructurally **P**ure.  
_A language that doesn’t decorate itself, but just is, with_ **L**ogic, **I**ntuition, **S**implicity and **P**ower.  
_Like math, like breath, like cons cells._
```  
  
  
```
**O**ccasionally **C**ompiles **A**fter **M**ental **L**imbo _– Will work if it compiles,  
but you have to_ **O**rder **C**onditions _and_ **A**lways **M**utate **L**azily _to be able to use these pure functions.  
A functional language for people who still need to cheat a little.  
Descend with_ Reason _when you lack those braces._
```  
  
  
```
**P**reprocessed **H**orror **P**arade   
_– It’s a_ **P**recariously **H**eld **P**atchwork _where each version removes ways to solve a problem, but you always find new.  
Rather than writing code, you’re performing a ritual to convince the interpreter that the workaround was the plan._  
**P**arse, **H**ope and **P**ray, _it’s the_ **P**rogrammer's **H**azardous **P**layground.
```  
  
  
```
**P**aths **E**ncrypted _by_ **R**andom **L**ogic.  
_Each script is a fossil, compressed insight from another time, by someone who knew exactly what they were doing, but never told the syntax.  
Its regexes are spells, its hashes are riddles, and its philosophy is simple: If it worked once… don’t touch it.  
**P**rogramming’s **E**ldritch **R**iddle **L**anguage.
```  
  
  
```
**P**rogrammers **Y**earning **T**o **H**ack **O**n **N**ew _stuff.  
It is the language that lets you build empires out of scripts, and then forget where the foundation is.  
It’s fun until it becomes infrastructure._ **J**ust **P**retend **Y**ou **T**yped **H**onestly **O**n **N**othing,  
_It’s invisible duck juggling and a great enabler._
```  
  
  
```
**P**retend **R**easoning **O**perates **L**ogically **O**ver **G**alaxies. 
_You state what should be true and ask it politely.  
It’s pretty much like SQL, if SQL had opinions and forgot what it was doing halfway through.  
It launches you into galaxies of unification and backtracking, where one misplaced fact can blackhole your entire knowledge base._  
**P**robably _just_ **R**eturning **O**ccasional **L**ists **O**f **G**uesses.
```  
  
  
```
**P**rogramming **A**gainst **S**implicity **C**reates **A**gonizing **L**egacy. _It gave us clarity and order, but we gave it confusion.  
Code that should have been pure soon looked like coming from a mantra like **P**lease **A**void **S**tructured **C**ode **A**ltogether, **L**ads,  
_because it felt like_ **P**rograms **A**rranged **S**tructurally **C**ould **A**ccidentally **L**oop.  
_We were beginners in one of the first strictly enforced languages that could give us perfection._
```  
  
  
```
**R**eally **U**nusual **B**lock **Y**ielding _gave us beauty and seemingly invisible power.  
It felt like origami, but freedom means_ **R**ewriting **U**ntil **B**ehavior **Y**ells, _or_ **R**ecursively **U**npacking **B**locks **Y**ourself.  
_It was elegance — until self changed mid-sentence.  
And then came Rails, where_ **R**epetition **U**sed _to_ **B**e **Y**ours. _You no longer understand how it works, just that it worked… once._
```  
  
  
```
**R** _obust Utility System Tool_ — A multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety. But the _Runtime is Unavailable_ so it’s a _Static Terror_, where you _Refactor Until Safety Takes over_ with the borrow checker, and it feels like _Realistically Useless Symbol Tracking_. You still need to _Remember Unsafe Syntax Temporarily_.
```  
  
  
```
**R**ender **E**verything **A**ll **C**ycles **T**ogether_ – not even a language, even though some might think so, but it’s named what it does._
```  
  
  
```
**S**pecifically **W**ritten **I**n **F**ast **T**ime _as we couldn’t stand Objective C for yet another day.  
It promised clarity but gave us forced unwrapping and three ways to write the same closure.  
We traded brackets for braces and header files for protocols, but we still don’t understand._ **S**yntactic **W**rapping **I**ntensifies **F**or **T**hemselves.
```  
  
  
```
**T**ype **Y**ourself **P**ainfully _into_ **E**ven _the_ **S**mallest **C**orner, _but case **R**ecovery **I**s **P**lain **T**error.  
_I heard you liked types, so we added some... with escape hatches. And then, types for the hatches. So now we need a type to explain why the types don’t help anymore._
```  
  
  
```
**V**iolently **I**mpure **S**yntax **U**sed **A**gainst **Logic, **B**ecause **A**ssembly **S**imply **I**sn't **C**ute _enough.  
What started as a teaching tool became an enterprise solution that whispered “Dim as Object” into the void of type safety._
```  
  
  
```
**X**tremely **M**isleading **L**anguage _as it isn’t a language at all. It’s just_ e**X**crem…al **M**essy **L**inguistics, _but I’m not going to put those words in my mouth, obviously._
