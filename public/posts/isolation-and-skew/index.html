    <h2>Isolation Levels and Write Skew</h2>
    <p><em>2016-10-08</em></p>
    <p>A few notes on isolation levels in relational databases—and a tricky little issue called <em>write skew</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="isolation-levels-in-brief">Isolation Levels in Brief</h2>
<p>Most relational databases default to the <strong>Read Committed</strong> isolation level. This prevents dirty reads, but does <em>not</em> protect you from more subtle anomalies such as <strong>read skew</strong> or <strong>write skew</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="read-skew-example">Read Skew Example</h3>
<p>Imagine one user moves data from location X to location Y, ensuring a value (say, 100 units) is transferred. If another user reads both locations during this operation, they might observe the same value in <em>both</em> places temporarily. That&rsquo;s <strong>read skew</strong>: the illusion of duplicated data due to timing.</p>

<p>To prevent this, you can increase the isolation level.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="serializable-vs-snapshot-isolation">Serializable vs Snapshot Isolation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Serializable isolation</strong> means operations behave <em>as if</em> executed sequentially. This is the strongest level and guarantees full consistency—but it&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Snapshot isolation</strong> is cheaper. Each transaction gets a consistent view of the data, and conflicting writes cause failure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, snapshot isolation doesn&rsquo;t protect against <strong>write skew</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="write-skew-example">Write Skew Example</h3>
<p>Imagine two users reading shared data with a rule that at least one of two fields must remain true. Each transaction reads, validates that the rule holds, and writes a change. But if both users update the same fields simultaneously, the invariant might break—because each acted on an outdated view.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="reality-in-practice">Reality in Practice</h2>
<p>Some databases, such as <strong>Oracle</strong>, don&rsquo;t support true serializable isolation. Their &ldquo;serializable&rdquo; mode is really snapshot isolation under the hood.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Writer Principle:</strong> Achieve serializability by allowing only one writer process.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Locks:</strong> Lock all rows or objects you read during the transaction to avoid skew.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods ensure correctness—though at the cost of concurrency.</p>
<hr>
<p>Isolation levels aren&rsquo;t just theoretical—they shape the behavior of concurrent applications. Choosing the right level (and knowing its limits) is crucial for correctness.</p>
