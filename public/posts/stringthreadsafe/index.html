    <h2>Strings: Thread Safe at Last</h2>
    <p><em>2005-05-22</em></p>
    <p>Yes! The class <code>java.lang.String</code> wasn’t officially thread-safe—according to the Java specification—until Java 1.5.</p>
<p>Now, <code>String</code> is designed to be immutable, which inherently <em>should</em> make it thread-safe. Its internal state is set during construction and can&rsquo;t be changed afterward. Internally, a <code>String</code> consists of a character array and two integers that define the range of characters representing the string. All these fields are declared <code>final</code>.</p>
<p>The issue? Version 2 of the <em>Java Language Specification</em>, specifically chapter 17, didn’t mention anything about <code>final</code> fields. This meant we couldn’t guarantee that another thread would see a properly initialized object, unless additional memory barriers (like <code>synchronized</code>) were in place. Without those, visibility of final fields across threads wasn’t ensured.</p>
<p>Take the <code>substring()</code> method as an example: it returns a new <code>String</code> object that shares the same underlying character array but with different range integers. Neither the constructor nor <code>substring()</code> uses synchronization. So if one thread constructs a substring and passes it to another, there&rsquo;s a risk that the receiving thread might see an inconsistent state—a string that doesn’t represent the expected value. Immutability alone wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>But with Java 5 (and the third edition of the spec), that changed. The language now guarantees that <code>final</code> fields are visible to other threads <em>after</em> the constructor finishes. This means that any other thread accessing the newly constructed object is guaranteed to see the fully initialized values.</p>
<p>So finally—yes, <em>finally</em>—<code>String</code> is thread-safe, even by the book.</p>
